# The evidence schema

Every call in an outcome run fills in the same structure. That is what makes calls
composable: the planner reads a uniform record rather than a transcript, so a call to a
supplier and a call to a depot are the same kind of input.

Pass it as `recipient_result_schema` on `POST /v1/calls`.

## Three CALL-E rules shaped this, and one of them cost a live call

The first was learned from an HTTP 400 on a real run. All three are in CALL-E's calls
guide. They are worth knowing before you write your own schema.

**1. A `type` is one value.** `{"type": ["object", "null"]}` is the natural way to say
"this field is optional", it is legal JSON Schema, and CALL-E rejects it:

```
HTTP 400 recipient_result_schema_invalid
"unsupported JSON Schema type at $.properties.offer: ['object','null']"
```

The supported list is `object`, `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array` — one
of them, not a union. `oneOf`, `anyOf` and `allOf` are also unsupported, and a union type
is those in shorthand. **Express absence with an empty string or an empty array**, never
with `null`.

**2. Some field names are reserved.** `summary`, `status`, `transcript`, `call_id` and
timing fields are reserved recipient response names. This schema says `what_is_offered`
because `summary` is not available.

**3. The result is all or nothing.** From the guide: "If CALL-E cannot produce a
schema-valid result from the evidence, the public `structured_result` is `null`." Not
partially filled — absent. So every field you mark `required` is a field that can throw
away the whole call.

That is why `required` here holds one entry. A caller who comes back with a clear verdict
and nothing quotable should still give you the verdict; requiring `facts` as well would
trade a partial answer for no answer at all.

For the same reason, **prices and dates are strings**. A number has no way to say "they
never quoted one", and `0` is a lie that a budget check would happily accept.

## The six verdicts

The enum is small on purpose. Each value maps to a different next move, and a verdict that
does not change what the planner does next does not deserve to exist.

| Verdict | What it means | What the planner does |
|---|---|---|
| `no_answer` | Nobody picked up | Retry once, under the per-party cap, then move on |
| `refused` | They declined to engage | Do not call back. Take any referral and move on |
| `blocked` | They would help but cannot, and said why | Record the blocker, take the referral, move on |
| `partial` | Something learned, objective unmet | Record it; usually move on |
| `offer` | A concrete proposal | Evaluate against constraints |
| `confirmed` | Objective met and committed to | Resolved, if this was an approved commit call |

## Parse it defensively

This is the least trustworthy input in the system: a model's reading of a phone
conversation, filled in under time pressure by a caller who may have been talked over. The
loop must not crash on it, and — more importantly — must not quietly invent the missing
half.

- **A price you cannot read is unknown, never zero.** Accept `"438"`, `"438.00"`,
  `"$438.00"`, `"USD 1,438"` and a bare number if one arrives anyway. Anything else is
  absent. Guessing `0` sails a quote straight past a budget ceiling.
- **A referral without a valid E.164 number is dropped.** See the Following A Referral
  section of `SKILL.md`.
- **A call the provider did not complete is never testimony.** If the CALL-E call status is
  `failed` or `canceled`, treat it as `no_answer` whatever the structured block says. A
  half-connected call can return a confidently filled-in result.
- **An empty `offer` object is not an offer.** Require at least a description, a price, or
  a date.
- **`reached: "no"` overrides the verdict**, and `"unknown"` does not. A call that cannot
  say whether it reached anyone has not established that it did not.

## Validate the schema before you dial

CALL-E validates `recipient_result_schema` at call-creation time and refuses with a 400,
so a malformed schema costs no credits — but it does cost you the run, and finding out
during a first live call against a real number is an avoidable way to spend an afternoon.

`scripts/check_evidence_schema.py` checks a returned result. For the schema itself, check
it against the documented subset before the first call: single `type` values, no
`$ref`/`oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`, `additionalProperties: false` on every object, every
`required` name present in `properties`, `items` on every array, and no reserved names at
the top level.

## Why not just read the transcript

A transcript is not a decision input. It is long, it is unstructured, and every planner
that reads one ends up re-deriving the same six facts with a second model call. Worse, it
cannot be replayed: a scripted transcript and a real one differ enough that a run you
rehearse offline is not the run that happens on the phone.

Filling a fixed schema on the call, while the person is still there to be asked, is both
cheaper and more accurate — and it means the planner is testable without a phone.
